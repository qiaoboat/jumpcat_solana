jumpcat project for solana hackthon

# Jumpcat

Jumpcat is decentralized prediction project, focus on real-time prediction in the field of sports and e-sports competition.

Jumpcat is a decentralized solution for prediction finance. Unlike other projects, it focuses more on real-time odds calculation, Oracle result is determined by the creation node, and at the same time, the board node and Dao governance are used for hierarchical verification.
Based on these new designs, users can trade real-time for the prediction results, and maximize profits through real-time judgments on the competition situation. At the same time, this kind of real-time prediction judgment will also optimize the viewing experience and bring a different feeling.

With the help of the speed of solana and low transaction cost, the real-time algorithm can automatically settle the real-time odds in the case of fund decentralization, and users can update their judgment of the situation in real time, such as AMM swap. Buy at a low price, sell at a high price, and get an extra profit compared to the traditional prediction market.

In the economic model, the transaction fee for real-time trading will empower the sustainable development of the project, while the governance token will also be used for the election of the board of directors, the license in a certain field(LOL, CSGO, NBA), so that the developer foundation, the board of directors and the license in different fields will form a win-win economic cycle.

At the same time, decentralization will also make the money safe and transparent. It is also possible to develop some fields such as follow order, leverage, lottery, online games, yield farming and so on in the future.
